# odin-recipes

This is my first TOP project where I will put into practice what I've learned about HTML until now.

For my recipes project, first I've created an index.html, then added a new folder where I put a new file called gallo-pinto.html in which I'll add the "Gallo Pinto" recipe. At next, I included a relative link to the "Gallo Pinto" page.
